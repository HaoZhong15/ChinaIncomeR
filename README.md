My final project introduces the development of an R package called ChinaIncomeR. This package includes a cleaned dataset named ChinaIncome, which contains agricultural, commercial, construction, industrial, and transportation output values from multiple regions. Using standard tools such as usethis, devtools, and roxygen2, the project demonstrates how to build an R package, document datasets, manage version control through Git/GitHub, and organize reproducible code through the accompanying R Markdown report. The project also incorporates a debugging workflow based on course material, including the use of traceback() to identify the source of errors, debug() to step through faulty logic, and browser() to insert breakpoints inside functions.

The R Markdown file further includes a visualization component that uses ggplot2 to generate a barplot. A deliberately misspelled column name is introduced to trigger an error, allowing debugging tools to be applied to locate and diagnose the issue before producing the corrected plot. Together, the package, dataset, and debugging demonstrations illustrate a complete workflow for building a documented, reproducible, and error-resilient R project. The original dataset can be found at:
